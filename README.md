# SettlersOfCatan

A recreation of my old AP CS final project in C++.

The end goal of SettlersOfCatan is to have a complete remake of the game that includes all expansions and has installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux (deb and rpm).

## Building
It's a pretty bog standard build system, but you'll need Qt5 installed.

Run `cmake .` to generate a makefile
and `make` to run the build.

I haven't tested this on any platform besides linux yet.
